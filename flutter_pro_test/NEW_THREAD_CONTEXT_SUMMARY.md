# CareNow MVP - New Thread Context Summary

## 🏥 Project Overview

I'm developing **CareNow MVP**, a comprehensive Vietnamese healthcare platform built with Flutter that connects clients with healthcare service providers through three distinct user roles:

- **Client App**: Users book home healthcare services (elder care, child care, pet care)
- **Partner App**: Healthcare providers manage job queues, accept bookings, and track earnings
- **Admin Dashboard**: Web-based management system for monitoring, analytics, and user management

### Current Development Status
- **Completed Phases**: 1-10 (Setup → Firebase → Data Layer → Authentication → User Management → Booking System → Partner Dashboard → Payment Integration → Real-time Features → Production Deployment)
- **Production Deployment**: Web app live at https://carenow-app-2024.web.app
- **Testing Coverage**: 400+ passing tests with 90%+ coverage
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with BLoC pattern, Firebase backend
- **Market Focus**: Vietnamese healthcare market with Vietnamese localization

```

### Firebase Integration
- **Project**: `carenow-app-2024`
- **Services**: Auth, Firestore, Storage, FCM, Crashlytics, Performance Monitoring
- **Security**: Environment-based API key configuration (no hardcoded secrets)
- **Configuration**: Secure build process with `.env` file management

## 🔒 Security Status

### Firebase API Key Security Incident - RESOLVED
**Background**: Accidentally exposed Firebase API keys in GitHub repository
**Exposed Keys**: 
- Web API Key: `AIzaSyCHjFdprKiFYY9DkKV0tkRPYyrjQfpSQu0`
- Android API Key: `AIzaSyCznKxPBBlYcLUNVewfQuI4LZu9KSLjl1o`

**Security Measures Implemented**: ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Environment-based API key configuration implemented
- ✅ Placeholder values in committed code (`firebase_options.dart`)
- ✅ Secure build process with `.env` file management
- ✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` patterns to prevent future exposure
- ✅ Git cleanup scripts created for history sanitization
- ✅ Security validation tests implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive security documentation created

**Current Security Status**: 🟢 SECURE
- All API keys now use `String.fromEnvironment()` with placeholder defaults
- Real API keys stored in `.env` file (properly gitignored)
- Security validation tests confirm no hardcoded secrets
- Production builds use secure environment variable injection
