# CareNow MVP - New Thread Context Prompt

## Project Overview
I'm developing **CareNow MVP**, a Vietnamese healthcare platform Flutter app with three user roles:
- **Client App**: Users book home care services
- **Partner App**: Care providers manage jobs and earnings  
- **Admin Dashboard**: Web-based management system

## Current Development Status
- **Completed**: Phases 1-10 with production-ready build
- **Features**: Authentication, booking system, payment integration (Stripe), real-time notifications, admin dashboard, analytics, security hardening
- **Testing**: 400+ passing tests with 90%+ coverage
- **Deployment**: Web app deployed at https://carenow-app-2024.web.app
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with BLoC pattern, Firebase backend

## ðŸš¨ URGENT SECURITY SITUATION
I accidentally exposed Firebase API keys in my GitHub repository using 'git add .' command. The exposed keys are publicly visible at:
https://github.com/Dyno8/flutter-project-test/blob/e6e4d2cd6c88a37d8493afae84725bbe4e1bb892/flutter_pro_test/lib/firebase_options.dart#L46

**Exposed Keys:**
- Web API Key: `AIzaSyCHjFdprKiFYY9DkKV0tkRPYyrjQfpSQu0`
- Android API Key: `AIzaSyCznKxPBBlYcLUNVewfQuI4LZu9KSLjl1o`

## Security Measures Already Implemented
âœ… **Immediate Actions Completed:**
- Replaced exposed API keys with placeholder values in `firebase_options.dart`
- Implemented environment-based configuration using `String.fromEnvironment()`
- Created `.env` file with secure placeholder values
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future exposure
- Created multiple Git cleanup scripts for history removal

âœ… **Security Infrastructure Created:**
- `scripts/emergency_secure_setup.sh` - Initial security setup
- `scripts/git_cleanup_immediate.sh` - Clean slate approach (RECOMMENDED)
- `scripts/git_cleanup_simple.sh` - Fixed filter-branch approach
- `scripts/git_cleanup_modern.sh` - Modern git-filter-repo approach
- `scripts/build_with_env.sh` - Secure build process
- `.env.example` - Safe environment template
- `EMERGENCY_SECURITY_RESPONSE.md` - Complete incident documentation

## Current File Structure
```
flutter_pro_test/
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                           # Real API keys (NEVER commit)
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example                   # Safe template
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/firebase_options.dart      # Now has placeholder values only
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ git_cleanup_immediate.sh   # RECOMMENDED cleanup approach
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ git_cleanup_simple.sh      # Fixed filter-branch approach  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ git_cleanup_modern.sh      # Modern git-filter-repo approach
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ build_with_env.sh          # Secure build process
â””â”€â”€ EMERGENCY_SECURITY_RESPONSE.md # Complete incident guide
```

## Immediate Actions Still Required
ðŸ”¥ **CRITICAL - Execute Immediately:**

1. **Run Git History Cleanup** (Choose one):
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Clean slate (RECOMMENDED)
   cd flutter_pro_test
   ./scripts/git_cleanup_immediate.sh
   
   # Option 2: Fixed simple approach
   ./scripts/git_cleanup_simple.sh
   
   # Option 3: Modern approach
   ./scripts/git_cleanup_modern.sh
   ```

2. **Force Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin main
   ```

3. **Regenerate Firebase API Keys:**
   - Go to Firebase Console â†’ carenow-app-2024 project
   - Delete and recreate all app configurations
   - Download new configuration files

4. **Update Environment:**
   - Edit `.env` with new API keys
   - Test secure build: `./scripts/build_with_env.sh web`

## Technical Context
- **Framework**: Flutter 3.x with Dart
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, FCM, Crashlytics)
- **State Management**: BLoC pattern with flutter_bloc
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (domain/data/presentation layers)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites with mockito
- **Security**: Environment-based configuration, secure build process
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting for web, Android APK builds

## Development Preferences
- Fix all compilation errors before running tests (flutter analyze first)
- Use package managers instead of manual dependency editing
- Comprehensive testing for all new features
- Clean architecture patterns with proper separation of concerns
- Security-first approach with environment variables for sensitive data

## Current Priority
**URGENT**: Complete the Firebase API key security cleanup and get the repository secured before proceeding with any new development work.

---

**Request**: Please help me complete the emergency security response for the exposed Firebase API keys, then continue with CareNow MVP development as needed.
